### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Css Preprocessor

### What I learned

This challenge helped me to start experiencing the preprocessor sass.
I explored the use of nesting, mixing and how to declare variables, always trying to understand the particularities and advantages of this tool.

### Continued development

In the next challenges continue to use sass to deepen the use of this tool and its possibilities
